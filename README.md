# Interactive Capability Model Learning (iCaML)

This is a fork of the repository for iCaML.
In this repository, we attempt to apply the ideas from iCaML to 3D robotic simulation environments.
To run our code, install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and then run
```
poetry shell
cd iCaML
python3 kuka.py
```

The following is the original readme text.

- dependencies: This directory includes the external software used to run the code. This includes FF, VAL, and PDDLGym. 
  - FF: https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff/FF-v2.3.tgz
  - PDDLGym: https://github.com/tomsilver/pddlgym
  - VAL: https://github.com/KCL-Planning/VAL

- dependencies: Place all the domains in this directory. There must be a directory for each domain containing: 
  - domain.pddl (domain file for that domain), and 
  - instances directory containing the problem files for that domain.

- gvg_agents: This has domain specific data including some results.

- src: This directory stores the source code for iCaML. It contains 4 files:
  - agent.py: Contains the agent code.
  - config.py: Declares the configuration parameters.
  - post_processing.py: Post Processing code for the learned pddl.
  - main.py : Contains the main driver code which runs the code end-to-end.

  src also contains code structured into following sub-directories:
  - interrogation: Contains the iCaML code.
  - lattice: Contains the model and lattice classes.
  - query: Contains the plan outcome query code.
  - sim: Simulator specific code. Contains a separate agent file for each simulator domain.
  - utils: Contains general utilities.

## Configuration

Configuration parameters are set in src/config.py

- FF_PATH and VAL_PATH stores relative path of FF and VAL respectively.
- PLANNER specifies which planner to use. Set it to FF only.

## How to Run

1. Install the required software
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```
2. Download FF, FD, and VAL and place in dependencies directory. Compile FF and FD.

3. Run main.py
```
cd src
python3 main.py
```

Please note that this is research code and not yet ready for public delivery, hence most parts are not documented.
